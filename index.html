            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
              Understanding the techniques of artists is an essential part of
              studying art and art history. The process of creating an artwork
              is often more valueable than the artwork itself. In traditional
              art historical discourses, art forms such as painting, sculpture
              and printmaking, can be studied by technically examining the
              artwork for evidence of technique. In digital art, this evidence
              are often lost as soon as the editing session on a piece of
              software ends.
            </p>

            <p>
              Artivity can document the creation process of your digital
              artwork. This is critical for attributing art which is
              increasingly shared online, but also for interpreting individual
              artworks and their context within a given social and technical
              environment. It is a long term self archiving tool which does not
              intefere with your practice.
